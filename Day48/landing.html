    Hanzi Maker is part of Counter Algorithmic Censorship Toolkit.<br><br>

    Censorship in China is speading beyond its border. It is affecting everyone, including you. (insert sentences about why people will find this tool useful) We invite you to create your own Hanzi (Chinese charachter) to bypass automated censorship. <br><br>

    If you have no prior knowledge about Hanzi, we recommend you to go through the Hanzi 101 session.<br><br>
